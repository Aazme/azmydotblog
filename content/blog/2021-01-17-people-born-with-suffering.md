title: People born with suffering

I once overheard a sentence that said: People are born to suffer. I didn't understand it very well at the time. I was thinking that maybe people are born to enjoy it. Now think about it, do you think you can enjoy living an ordinary life? Traveling between the busy side or the other side of the traffic every day, in order not to be too desolate, in front of friends, you should be very tired, but you can’t give up, because you have to survive. To bear all this, this is reality, and this is the life story of many people.

Apart from these, what are we left? In fact, our life is very short. It is really very short. I don’t know if others have this experience. Your parents who were once young, when you were still in elementary school, junior high school, or even high school, I still think that they are very young and separated. It's still early to age, and I don't know what year it happened. But I don’t know why. In the few years after graduation, I really feel that time has passed faster and faster. My age is getting older and older, and the aging of my parents is more and more obvious. I think back 10 years ago. The season now seems to be yesterday, so the most terrifying thing is not the length of life, just a lot of things, we can't do it, because time is like flowing water, slipping away in the gap.

So good, the question is here, what should we do and what should we do so that each other does not regret it? you ask me? I don't know, I'm not a saint, and a saint doesn't necessarily know, let alone who has seen a saint. This question is like, why do people live and what they live for, there is no answer. So you can only ask yourself, be loyal to your heart, and try not to let yourself lose faith in this chaotic world. Be nice to different people and things, maybe it will be really different.

Actually I'm talking nonsense...
